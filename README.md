Inverse design of metasurface using Generative Adversarial Neural Network
I have recently been working on predicting the structure of a 2D gratings using the transmittance/Phase data of the grating.
I used FDTD to collect the needed data
Now I am stuck in getting a best GAN network that will be able to predict structures from the transmittance /phase datas
Anyone with an idea????
